# Simple Logging Function in JavaScript

This project provides a simple logging function in JavaScript that writes messages to a text file with a timestamp. The function is intended to be used in a Node.js environment.

## Getting Started

To use the logging function, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js, you can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Tests
To execute the unit tests for the logger function, use the following command:

```bash
 npx mocha .\inventoryManagement.test.js
```

Mocha will automatically discover and run the tests in the logger.test.js file, and you'll see the test results in the terminal.
